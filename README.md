## Setup
PHP version 8.1.3
```
composer install
```
Run a web server using the `public` folder
For testing purposes I used the VS code live server ( it runs `php -S ` with
preconfigured runtime arguments)

### Run tests
Make sure to run `composer install` first
then run `vendor\bin\phpunit tests` if you are on windows
